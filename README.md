# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my corner of GitHub 🚀  

I’m an **ISTQB-Certified Software QA Engineer** with **12+ years of breaking (and fixing) things** 💥🛠️.  
From **streaming platforms** to **hardware integration**, I’ve made it my mission to ensure software doesn’t just *work*… it works **flawlessly** ✨.  

---

## 🧪 What I Do Best
- 🕹️ Manual + Automated Testing (yes, I enjoy both 🤓)  
- 🧩 Designing Test Artifacts that are concise and *actually* make sense  
- 🤝 Teaming up with devs, PMs, and fellow QAs to ship smooth releases  
- 🕵️ Finding bugs before they find you 🐛  

---

## 🔧 My Toolbox
- **Testing Wizards:** Sikuli, Postman, Cypress, Fiddler, GitHub Actions, BrowserStack  
- **Tracking Stuff Down:** Jira, Phabricator, Linear, GitHub  
- **Test Management Magic:** KiwiTCMS, Kanoah, Testiny, Qase
- **Code-y Side Quests:** Python 🐍, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Databases:** SQL-flavored adventures 🗄️  

---

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- 🔧 Built tools to boost test coverage (because who doesn’t love more coverage?)  
- 🏆 Helped ship products *on time* without turning QA into chaos  
- 👨‍🏫 Mentored QAs and spread the **“quality-first” mindset**  
- 🚨 Known for catching bugs that devs *swore* they “cannot replicate in their machine”

## 🎉 Outside of QA
 - 🐶 A furdad of a pug and a beagle
 - 🍡 Has a passion for food and travel when I can afford it, I guess
 - 🎮 Gamer and wannabe streamer
